The project is split into two parts: the smart contract backend and the React-based frontend. 
The backend is written in Solidity and lives in the contracts directory, where TicketToken.sol handles all core logic related to ticket minting, ownership, transfers, and payment.
The frontend is contained within the frontend-react folder and is built using React and TailwindCSS. It includes separate pages for key user actions such as buying tickets, transferring them, and managing wallets.
